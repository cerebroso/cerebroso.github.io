      <h5 class="card-title">Inner Selfish</h5>
      <p class="card-text">
        I watched you turn into somebody else<br/>
        Have you found what you seek here<br/>
        You seem to always have the answer<br/>
        No matter who is asking<br/>
        Behind your eyes<br/>
        You'd think that there's life<br/>
        But you died so long ago<br/>
        And so as you die tonight<br/>
        You still want to believe<br/>
        That you've been alive before<br/>
        Now spare your cries<br/>
        We've seen this part<br/>
        You're just afraid of a world without your face<br/>
        This is your demise<br/>
        But you still want to believe<br/>
        That you've been right all this time

      <h5 class="card-title">Deadlock</h5>
      <p class="card-text">
        Locked here one more time<br/>
        Inside my mind where Iâ€™m supposed to be<br/>
        Feeling sober but still high<br/>
        Cutting off pieces of me for life<br/>
        I'm always tired of this place <br/>
        Never cared for anything but the way out<br/>
        I've waited for something else all my life<br/>
        Couldn't see it grow all this time<br/>
        I think I'm losing it all again<br/>
        All that time Looking into my blank mind<br/>
        I'm sure I wasn't there all along<br/>
        I'm making promises that I can't comply with<br/>
        But my face tells the truth so I won't deny<br/>
        I've waited for something else all my life<br/>
        Couldn't see it grow all this time<br/>
        I think I'm losing it all again

      <h5 class="card-title">Escape</h5>
      <p class="card-text">
        Well, it's been some time<br/>
        Since I ran away from all I did<br/>
        Can't remember the last time I felt alive<br/>
        I'll break myself<br/>
        Away from the person that I wanna be<br/>
        If it's all you're asking from me<br/>
        And maybe, everything has its purpose in the end<br/>
        But I'm letting it tear a part of me<br/>
        I'm letting it crash on you<br/>
        You'll break yourself<br/>
        Away from the person that you wanna be<br/>
        If it's what I'm asking<br/>
        Would you bear all this pain<br/>
        And if it seems everlasting<br/>
        Remember that in our heads<br/>
        Just reflections of times when we used to escape<br/>
        From here, from us<br/>
        The clock is ticking<br/>
        Everytime, it keeps getting faster<br/>
        And know this isn't a part of life<br/>
        Where it gets better
      </p>

      <h5 class="card-title">High</h5>
      <p class="card-text">
        Under your chest<br/>
        You drown in anxiety<br/>
        About what comes<br/>
        After you realize that<br/>
        Your ego is a disguise<br/>
        For the moments the world gets by<br/>
        And you can't feel<br/>
        When you're this blind<br/>
        Fear will wear you out<br/>
        If you don't pick up<br/>
        And step out of your head<br/>
        It gets lonelier on every step<br/>
        But the lesson here<br/>
        Is bigger than ourselves<br/>
        FEAR.WILL.WEAR.YOU.OUT

      <h5 class="card-title">NPC</h5>
      <p class="card-text">
        My will, as I'm trashed<br/>
        Will I stand still on my own<br/>
        Don't leave me hanging on this burst rope<br/>
        Set me free, I'll never be<br/>
        Why should I trust my uneventful endeavours<br/>
        To save you from yourself<br/>
        Knowing I can't make you feel better
      </p>

  <div class="card">
    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="card-title">Sentience</h5>
      <p class="card-text">
        These lapses of happiness<br/>
        In a string of reality<br/>
        Some strange reason<br/>
        Brings me back to normality<br/>
        So I begin to see myself<br/>
        As another part of this<br/>
        And it seems like every moment is drab<br/>
        When realization brings no surprises<br/>
        And progress feels like denying<br/>
        Everything you ever felt was true<br/>
        Something you can't conceal or<br/>
        Nothing that ever made a difference to anyone but you  <br/>
        Regret is not what one should feel<br/>
        When standing against oneself<br/>
        But freedom within your thoughts<br/>
        To understand what it is to grow<br/>
        When you have nothing but your own
      </p>

  <div class="card">
    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="card-title">Samsara</h5>
      <p class="card-text">
        Deep inside and beyond the stars<br/>
        There's nothing, but it still would tear us in parts<br/>
        What does it say about us and our minds<br/>
        How can we believe?<br/>
        How can we see clear?<br/>
        Looking up so close<br/>
        We meet our destiny<br/>
        Fading like a soul<br/>
        Trading itself for control<br/>
        Of a body trapped on earth<br/>
        Full of sorry eyes and cold blood<br/>
        Shedding your skin<br/>
        Drifting away from your being<br/>
        This body will show<br/>
        The silence echoing in you
      </p>
